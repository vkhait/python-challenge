The repository contains two folders: PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder contains a csv file, a main.py file with the python script and an 'analysis' folder with the results printed in a .txt file.

PyBank:
The dataset (budget_data) is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
  The total number of months included in the dataset.
  The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
  The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.
  The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
  The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
  
  
  
PyPoll:
The dataset (election_data) is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 
The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
  The total number of votes cast.
  A complete list of candidates who received votes.
  The percentage of votes each candidate won.
  The total number of votes each candidate won.
  The winner of the election based on popular vote.
